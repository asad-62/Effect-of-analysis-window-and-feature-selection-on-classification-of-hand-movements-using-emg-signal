# Effect-of-analysis-window-and-feature-selection-on-classification-of-hand-movements-using-emg-signal

This is the code for the paper "Effect of Analysis Window and Feature Selection on Classification of Hand Movements Using EMG Signal". The repository contain two MATLAB scripts. The first file "preprocessing_data_and_Extracting_fearures" preprocess the signal and extract the features and the second file "Code_for_shuffling_test_train_split" appends the true vale against the corresponding features values and then shuffles the feature values into test train split according to repetitions.
